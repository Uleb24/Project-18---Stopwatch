# Project-18---Stopwatch
Stopwatch made using Python - An intermediary Python project

Tried to make it more modern looking with basic CSS code, since my main goal is learning Front-End/Full-Stack engineering, as well as working with data and perhaps ML in the future.

This is an intermediary project, as it is not quite for beginners, yet not classifiable as a difficult project neither.

See you in my last Project - Project 19, before a big pause and overhaul in my repository !
